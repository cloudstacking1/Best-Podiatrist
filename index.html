<h3> Understanding Bunions and Their Treatment


</h3>

<p>Bunions are bony bumps that form on the joint at the base of your big toe. They occur when some of the bones in the front part of your foot move out of place, causing the tip of your big toe to be pulled towards the smaller toes. This misalignment causes the joint at the base of your big toe to stick out, resulting in pain, swelling, and difficulty walking.



 </p>

<h3>Bunion Surgery: What to Expect


 </h3>

<p>When conservative treatments fail to relieve bunion pain and prevent the progression of the deformity, bunion surgery may be recommended. At Bunionectomy Surgery Long Island, we specialize in advanced bunion surgery techniques, including <a href="https://bunionectomysurgerylongisland18.mypixieset.com/
